title: "Multilanguage Support"
---

This template supports multiple languages for your documentation.  

To enable multilingual content:  
1. Go to the **General** tab of your Content Island project.  
2. Select the language(s) you want to support.  

If you select multiple languages, the CLI will ask you to choose which one should be used as the **primary language**.  
Your project will then provide support for all the languages you’ve enabled.

> **Note**: Multilanguage support requires upgrading to one of the following plans: **Professional, Team, or Enterprise**.
