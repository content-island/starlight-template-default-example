## What is Create Content Island?

Create Content Island is a powerful command-line tool designed to seamlessly integrate [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation sites with [Content Island CMS](https://contentisland.net/). It automates the process of syncing content from your CMS to your documentation site, making it easy to maintain up-to-date documentation.

## Key Features

- **Two-Command Workflow**: `init` for setup, `update` for regular syncing
- **Automatic Token Management**: Securely stores and reuses API tokens
- **Dynamic Sidebar Generation**: Automatically creates navigation from your content structure
- **Content Validation**: Ensures your project is properly configured before syncing
- **TypeScript Support**: Built with TypeScript for better developer experience

## How It Works

1. **Initialize**: Run `cistar init` in your Starlight project to set up Content Island integration
2. **Configure**: Provide your Content Island API token (stored securely for future use)
3. **Sync**: Use `cistar update` anytime to refresh your content from the CMS
4. **Build**: Your documentation is ready to build and deploy with fresh content
